Overview
---------

In both HSR and PRP protocols, the DAN (Dual Attached Node) sends an
identical frame to both the interfaces and uses a sequence number in the
tag to allow drop duplicates at the Rx node to achieve redundancy. This
section describes the different software components of a Linux based
HSR/PRP solution to support redundancy.

HSR/PRP Driver source code and Kconfig option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The driver source code is located under net/hsr-prp folder of the Linux
source tree. To build kernel with this driver, set Kconfig option
CONFIG\_HSR=y in the dotconfig or enable it from the menu.

.. _hsr-prp-overview-and-setup:

Linux HSR/PRP Driver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Linux networking subsystem in upstream kernel has added support for
HSR driver starting in v3.12 (HSRv0 - IEC 62439-3:2010) and enhanced the
same to support HSRv1 (IEC 62439-3:2012) in v4.6. This driver allows
user to create an HSR network device with a pair of slave network
interfaces (A and B) that are standard Ethernet interfaces. For example
on TI's AM572x IDK EVM, there are two Ethernet interfaces (10/100) per
each PRU ICSS. The PRU Emac driver available for ICSS PRU Ethernet h/w
supports two Ethernet ports. Using ip link command, user will be able to
setup a HSR interface on this EVM that pair the two PRU Ethernet
interfaces to create a HSR node or **DAN-H**.

TI has enhanced the Linux HSR driver and ip link command in iproute2
package to support PRP defined in IEC 62439-3 clause 4. With this
change, user will be able to create a Doubly Attached Node with PRP
(**DAN-P**) using standard Ethernet interfaces. As in the case of HSR,
using ip link command, user will be able to setup a prp interface using
two Ethernet interfaces such as the one provided by PRU Dual EMAC driver.

Linux HSR/PRP driver provides a standard Ethernet interface to
application layer and hide the details of the redundancy protocol under
the driver layer. Linux HSR/PRP driver implements the Link Redundancy
Entity (LRE) that is central to implementing redundancy using respective
protocol.

HSR LRE functions and L2 routing can be offloaded to the firmware
running on the PRU cores of ICSS. The diagram below shows the
architecture of an Offloaded HSR/PRP driver. The upper layer driver is
existing Linux HSR/PRP driver described in the previous section. The PRU
Ethernet driver exports HSR/PRP capabilities in the NetDev feature
flags. The green blocks in the Redundancy layer shows the software
blocks that gets offloaded to PRUs in ICSS which is shown green as well.
The upper layer HSR/PRP driver uses the feature flags exported by the
PRU Ethernet driver to disable corresponding functions in its layer. The
firmware is a re-use from the TI RTOS implementation that is discussed
above. Re-use means the data structures and API should be re-used across
both TI RTOS and Linux driver implementations. A common PRU Ethernet
driver is developed to support existing Dual EMAC device as well HSR/PRP

.. _SITARA_HSR_PRP_id_if_number_mapping:

PRU-ICSS Subsystem Driver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PRU-ICSS Subsystem Driver provide a set of functions to client driver
such as PRU Ethernet (described in next section) to load and run firmware
on a specific core, such as PRU on a PRU-ICSS. On a SoC, there can be 1 or
2 instance of the PRU-ICSS and client driver might want to know which
instance it is referring to. PRU-ICSS sysfs files are specific to an instance
and user might have to know what instance the file refers to. Following
mapping is used for the ID based on the SoC and the PRU-ICSS instance.

+---------------------------+------+-----------+--------------------+
| SoC                       | ID   | if number | ICSS TRM reference |
+===========================+======+===========+====================+
| AM3                       |  0   | eth0/1    | PRU-ICSS           |
+---------------------------+------+-----------+--------------------+
| AM4                       |  0   | eth1/2    | PRU-ICSS0          |
+---------------------------+------+-----------+--------------------+
| AM571                     |  1   | eth2/3    | PRU-ICSS1          |
+---------------------------+------+-----------+--------------------+
| AM571                     |  2   | eth4/5    | PRU-ICSS2          |
+---------------------------+------+-----------+--------------------+
| AM572/4                   |  2   | eth2/3    | PRU-ICSS2          |
+---------------------------+------+-----------+--------------------+

In the following section, the PRU-ICSS ID is used in the sysfs file path
and the same can be obtained from the table above to know which PRU-ICSS
the file refers to.

You can also check which PRU-ICSS an ethernet interface belongs to via command
line, e.g. eth2 on different platforms:

AM571x:

::

 root@am57xx-evm:~# ls -l /sys/class/net/eth2 | grep device
 lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             0 Jun 10 11:29 device -> ../../../pruss1_eth

AM572x:

::

 root@am57xx-evm:~# ls -l /sys/class/net/eth2 | grep device
 lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             0 Jun 10 11:29 device -> ../../../pruss2_eth

PRU Ethernet Driver (Dual EMAC/HSR/PRP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of Processor SDK 7.x, the PRU Ethernet driver supports HSR/PRP/SWITCH
firmware offload. The PRU Ethernet driver initially probe in Dual EMAC mode and
loads Dual EMAC firmware. HSR/PRP/SWITCH are the firmware offload cases.  Please
refer to RSTP section on PRUETH SWITCH driver.  When a HSR/PRP firmware is
loaded, the PRU Ethernet driver will do proper firmware configurations and
notify the Linux HSR/PRP driver (under net/hsr directory. Also referred to
as upper driver) stack that offload has been enabled through netdev feature
flags. From then on, LRE functionality at the rx side is disabled in Linux
HSR/PRP upper driver and carried out in firmware.  Tx LRE function continues
to be in Linux HSR/PRP driver. i.e Tx frame duplication and Supervision frame
generation is still done in the upper driver.

Notice that, from the user point of view, all of the above mentioned
driver behavior is transparent to the user.

.. note:: For all discussion and examples shown, AM57xx device is used as
	   example, but different devices will use different ports. Please
	   see :ref:`SITARA_HSR_PRP_id_if_number_mapping` for interface
	   number and PRU-ICSS ID information for different SoCs.

As of Processor SDK 5.1.x, the driver supports 2 instances of HSR/PRP
one on each of PRU-ICSS on AM5xxx as per table below.

Queue Usage and VLAN PCP to Queue Map
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

At the Ingress, there are two queues available for queueing the frames
coming from each port or PRU to Host and two queues available for packets
from Host to each PRU. At the Egress, there are additionally two more
queues used for forward traffic from PRU1 to PRU0 and vice-versa. PRUETH
driver configures the PCP to Queue MAP in Shared RAM which is used by firmware
to decide which queue to pick to enqueue frames towards Host or other
PRU. Priority queues are assigned based on the PCP value in VLAN tag
of an Ethernet frame. Untagged frame is treated like PCP 0. Here is
the mapping value configured by driver in 4 bytes starting at offset
QUEUE_2_PCP_MAP_OFFSET (defined in icss_lre_firmware.h). Same mapping is
used for Ingress and Egress traffic.

The convention is that higher queue value corresponds to lower priority

**For HSR/PRP Ethernet types**

- At ingress to Host

::

 byte 0 - To host from PRU 1, PCP 0-3 => Q3
 byte 1 - To host from PRU 1, PCP 4-7 => Q2
 byte 2 - To host from PRU 0, PCP 0-3 => Q1
 byte 3 - To host from PRU 0, PCP 4-7 => Q0

At the ingress, firmware inspect the PCP value in the incoming Ethernet
frame's VLAN tag and choose a priority queue to enqueue the frame based on
the above mapping.

- At egress from host to wire/network

::

 PRU0/PRU1
 ---------
 byte 0 - from Host to PRU, PCP 0-3 => Q3
 byte 1 - from Host to PRU, PCP 4-7 => Q2

 PRU0
 -----
 byte 2 - from PRU1 to PRU0, PCP 0-3 => Q1
 byte 3 - from PRU1 to PRU0, PCP 4-7 => Q0

 PRU1
 -----
 byte 2 - from PRU0 to PRU1, PCP 0-3 => Q1
 byte 3 - from PRU0 to PRU1, PCP 4-7 => Q0

Driver choose the priority queue for egress transmission based on the
PCP value of the Ethernet frame received from the upper layer.  Firmware
sends the frames first from Q0 and Q2 in a round robin fashion. Once these
queues are drained, it then sends from the next higher queues Q1 and Q3
again in a round robin fashion. At the egress, Q0/Q1 are port queues and
Q2/Q3 are host queues.

**For Dual EMAC Ethernet type**

In Dual EMAC case, mapping is hard coded in firmware.

- At ingress to Host

::

 From PRU0 to Host, PCP 0-3 => Q1
 From PRU0 to Host, PCP 4-7 => Q0

 From PRU1 to Host, PCP 0-3 => Q3
 From PRU1 to Host, PCP 4-7 => Q2

- At egress from host to wire/network

::

 PRU0/PRU1
 -- ---------
 From Host to PRU0/PRU1, PCP 0-1 => Q3
 From Host to PRU0/PRU1, PCP 2-3 => Q2
 From Host to PRU0/PRU1, PCP 4-5 => Q1
 From Host to PRU0/PRU1, PCP 6-7 => Q0

Firmware sends the frames first from Q1, and then from the next higher
queue (Q2) and so forth.

For Dual EMAC and SWITCH ethernet types, at the Ingress, two separate irq
handlers are assigned to each port to process the packets. Driver uses
NAPI and NAPI polling is kicked once the interrupt event is received by
for each port. Packets are drained by the NAPI Poll function.

For HSR/PRP Ethernet type, an interrupt is attached to a pair of High
Priority Queues and another interrupt to the pair of low priority queues.
each queue is associated with a port. Two NAPI instances used, one for
high priority queues and another for low priority queues to independently
scan and drain the queues from the two ports. Interrupt handler kicks
NAPI. NAPI poll handler drains packets from the High priority or Low
priority queues based on timestamp maintained in memory. i.e packets are
ordered based on the timestamp.

.. _Changing_protocol_at_PRU_Ethernet:

Changing protocol at PRU Ethernet
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

PRU Ethernet driver supports multiple protocols/Ethernet types based
on the firmware loaded on ICSS PRU. By default, the PRU Ethernet driver
is probed to be in the Dual EMAC mode and EMAC firmware is loaded on to the
PRU. From this mode, user will be able to change to one of the Ethernet
type without having to reboot the board:-

* HSR
* PRP

Two feature flags are added to help offload HSR or PRP in the PRU
Ethernet driver :- hsr-rx-offload and prp-rx-offload. PRU Firmware
essentially offload the rx side processing of LRE, such as duplicate
detection and drop, node table update, stats update etc. To reflect the
same, the features are named with a rx-offload suffx to the protocol name.
Ethtool command has an option -K to set or clear the feature in a network
device. So this flag can be set or reset rx offload feature in the PRU
Ethernet device. As the device may be hooked up to a upper HSR/PRP network
device, user is expected to delete the hsr or prp interface before
changing the flag at the PRU Ethernet device. General procedure to change
protocol at PRU Ethernet device is as follows:-

Below assumes that hsr or prp interface using the PRU Ethernet devices
is currently deleted. Here are the steps at a high level:-

1. Bring down the two PRU Ethernet interfaces using ifconfig and
unassign the ip address using ifconfig. For example

::

    ifconfig eth2 down 0.0.0.0
    ifconfig eth3 down 0.0.0.0

2. If the PRU Ethernet device is currently running HSR or PRP offload
feature, the same has to be disabled before switching to Dual EMAC or another
protocol using ethtool -K option. For example if HSR is currently
running, do

::

       ethtool -K eth2 hsr-rx-offload off
       ethtool -K eth3 hsr-rx-offload off

Similarly if PRP is currently running, do

::

       ethtool -K eth2 prp-rx-offload off
       ethtool -K eth3 prp-rx-offload off

3. If user would like to offload HSR, enable the feature hsr-rx-offload
on both devices.

::

      ethtool -K eth2 hsr-rx-offload on
      ethtool -K eth3 hsr-rx-offload on

4. Now the PRU Ethernet devices can be paired to create an HSR interface
using ip link command. To offload PRP user does following command in
step 3

::

      ethtool -K eth2 prp-rx-offload on
      ethtool -K eth3 prp-rx-offload on

To display the offload feature currently active at the PRU Ethernet,
user may type following command for example for eth2

::

      ethtool -k eth2

.. rubric:: Sample commands
   :name: sample-commands

Before using these commands, save the MAC address of both interfaces.
These sample commands assumes a MAC address of 70:FF:76:1C:0E:8C for
both PRU Ethernet interfaces and an IP address of 192.168.2.20 for the
hsr/prp interface. Eth3 MAC address is assumed to be 70:FF:76:1C:0E:8E.
Also assumes user create hsr0 or prp0 interface using eth2 and eth3
interfaces. Please note that for each DAN, user needs to assign unique
MAC address and IP address from the same subnet.

Multicast filtering
--------------------

Multicast filtering is an Ethernet frame filtering feature in PRU firmware based
on the destination MAC address of the received frame. The PRU provides a
Multicast filter table in Data RAM1 of PRU with a size of 256 entries of 1
byte each. Firmware implements an imperfect match for filtering the frames based
on a hash calculated using the destination MAC address of the frame if the
destination address is a multicast MAC address.

::

 Hash = (MAC_ADDR[0] XOR
         MAC_ADDR[1] XOR
         MAC_ADDR[2] XOR
         MAC_ADDR[3] XOR
         MAC_ADDR[4] XOR
         MAC_ADDR[5])

Where MAC_ADDR is the multicast MAC address which is extracted from the destination
address of the Ethernet frame. A bitwise XOR operation is performed on each byte of
MAC address to get the hash value. The hash is used to index into the Multicast
filter table to check if it is set (1) or reset (0).  If set, the frame is forwarded
to ARM core (a.k.a Host). If reset, the frame is dropped at the PRU. This is an
imperfect match since there can be multiple MAC addresses that produces the same
hash value. So these frames will get forwarded to the ARM core.

Typically, an application joins the multicast group either using a raw socket of type
SOCK_DGRAM and use setsockopt() API to Join or leave the multicast group. An
interesting article on this is available at

http://www.tenouk.com/Module41c.html

This causes the Multicast MAC address to be added to the mc_list of the
socket and the associated network device in kernel and finally get passed
to the Ethernet device driver (in our case, it is PRU Ethernet device
driver). The relevant API is ndo_set_rx_mode() of the net_device_ops
structure in Linux kernel associated with the network device. The PRU
Ethernet device driver calculates the hash as described above and then
writes 1 to MC filter table using the hash value as index. The PRU Ethernet
device driver also supports allmulti which is used to enable receieve of
all multicast frames at an interface. This is an option passed to the
ifconfig command.

::

 Example
 >ifconfig eth2 192.168.2.20 allmulti

 To remove the option
 >ifconfig eth2 192.168.2.20 -allmulti

 To display the Multicast address list of an interface, say eth2, user types
 >ip maddr show dev eth2

Sample display

::

Dual EMAC
^^^^^^^^^

The multicast filter table(s) are stored in each PRU's Data RAM (PRU0->Data RAM0,
PRU1->Data RAM1) instead of one table in Data RAM1 as for HSR/PRP.

RSTP Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^

In case of RSTP switch mode, multicast filtering is available for
Host/CPU port only. There is a per port multicast filter
table in firmware that can be configured to indicate which of the
multicast addresses are allowed to forwarded to host port from the given
port. Linux driver sets up both filter table to be identical.
Note that currently there is no way to disable multicast filter in RSTP
switch mode (setting ALLMULTI on the bridge port has no effect
currently).

Multicast filter has no affect on L2 cut-throughput forwarding of
multicast packets.

Testing Multicast filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On slave side (i.e device connected to Dual EMAC or Switch port) start
UDP iperf client:

::

 root@slave:~# ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.55
 root@slave:~# route add 224.1.100.1 eth0
 root@slave:~# iperf -c  224.1.100.1 -u -t 600

On host side, multicast packets are reported as being dropped as
firmware filter is not set to allow this unregistered addresses to host
port. Here host port refers to  one of the PRU Ethernet's port in Dual EMAC
mode or the bridge port in case of RSTP switch mode. This can be
verified with ethtool

::

 root@am57xx-evm:~# ethtool -S eth2 | grep multicastDropped
      multicastDropped: 35

This shows that filtering is indeed working.

Now start a UDP iperf server bound to same multicast IP on host side
(one of the Dual EMAC ports say eth2 or bridge port say br0 in case of
RSTP switch mode):

::

 root@am57xx-evm:~# ifconfig eth2 10.0.0.1
 root@am57xx-evm:~# route add 224.1.100.1 eth2
 root@am57xx-evm:~# iperf -s -u -B 224.1.100.1 -i 5
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Server listening on UDP port 5001

 [  3] 10.0-15.0 sec   640 KBytes  1.05 Mbits/sec   0.022 ms    0/  446
  (0%)

Packets are no longer dropped and are received by the host.

VLAN over PRU Ethernet
-----------------------

Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a standard Linux feature that can be enabled over
PRU Ethernet devices. There are many websites that describes how Linux
VLAN works. Some of them are at
[`[2] <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VLAN>`__] or at
[`[3] <http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10821>`__] and some
configuration details are also discussed at
[`[4] <https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-configure-linux-virtual-local-area-network-vlan.html>`__].

User may use ip link command to setup vlan interface over prueth
interfaces. For example, over a hsr interface, if user would like to
setup two vlan interfaces say, hsr0.2 and hsr0.3, user execute the
following commands assuming the hsr0 interface is already setup:-

Node-1

::

    ifconfig hsr0 0.0.0.0
    ip link add link hsr0 name hsr0.2 type vlan id 2
    ip link add link hsr0 name hsr0.3 type vlan id 3
    ifconfig hsr0.2 192.168.2.40
    ifconfig hsr0.3 192.168.3.40
    ip link set hsr0.2 type vlan egress 0:0
    ip link set hsr0.3 type vlan egress 0:7

Node-2

::

    ifconfig hsr0 0.0.0.0
    ip link add link hsr0 name hsr0.2 type vlan id 2
    ip link add link hsr0 name hsr0.3 type vlan id 3
    ifconfig hsr0.2 192.168.2.50
    ifconfig hsr0.3 192.168.3.50
    ip link set hsr0.2 type vlan egress 0:0
    ip link set hsr0.3 type vlan egress 0:7

The above assume we have a network with two nodes connected back to
back. The procedure is same if more than two nodes are present in the
network. Using similar commands, user would be able to overlay multiple
virtual LANs over the physical LAN created. The egress option of ip link
command allow mapping packet priority to VLAN PCP values. In the example
the packets on VLAN ID 2 is mapped to PCP value of 0 and VLAN ID 3 is
mapped to PCP value of 7. At the Egress PRU Ethernet device looks at the
PCP value and places it into one of the 4 queues. PRU scan the high
priority queue first for packets and transmits them before transmitting
packets from the lower priority queues. At the ingress, the PRU checks
the PCP value of the packet in the VLAN header and places the frame into
one of the ingress queues. More details on Queue usage is available at
`Queue Usage and VLAN PCP to Queue Map <#queue-usage-and-vlan-pcp-to-queue-map>`__

In the above example, after passing some UDP traffic over hsr0.2 and
hsr0.3, the user may check following statistics to verify if the packets
are going over the right VLAN interface

On Node-1

::

    cat /proc/net/vlan/hsr0.3
    hsr0.3  VID: 3   REORDER_HDR: 1  dev->priv_flags: 1001
             total frames received        68090

    INGRESS priority mappings: 0:0  1:0  2:0  3:0  4:0  5:0  6:0 7:0

    root@am57xx-evm:~# cat /proc/net/vlan/hsr0.2

            total frames received        68105
             total bytes received     52604702
          Broadcast/Multicast Rcvd           53

          total frames transmitted        68074
           total bytes transmitted     52583138
    Device: hsr0
    INGRESS priority mappings: 0:0  1:0  2:0  3:0  4:0  5:0  6:0 7:0
     EGRESS priority mappings: 0:0

Similar procedure can be used for setting up VLAN interfaces over PRU
Dual EMAC and HSR Ethernet types.

VLAN Filtering
---------------

The PRU has a 4096 entry VLAN filter table that allows filtering out
unwanted VLAN traffic to the host. As soon a VLAN interface is created,
the 802.1q Linux kernel module sends the VID information down to the
lower layer HSR or PRP Linux device which in turn pass it down to the
slave Ethernet devices below it (or directly to the Ethernet device in the
case of Dual EMAC). The PRU Ethernet driver gets the VID information via
net_device_ops:ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid(). On receiving this, PRU Ethernet
driver sets the entry at the VID index in VLAN filter table
to 1. When the VLAN interface is deleted, the driver receives the same
information through ndo_vlan_rx_kill_vid() and reset the entry at the
VID index.

PRU firmware on receiving a VLAN frame, extracts the VID and look up the
VLAN filter table for an entry at the VID if VLAN filtering is enabled
in firmware. If the entry is 1, it forwards the frame to the Host.
Otherwise the frame is dropped. There are additional controls to allow
priority tagged frames to Host if the corrsponding bit is set in firmware
shared memory. PRU Ethernet driver always enables Priority tagged frames
to the Host. User may setup a VLAN interface with VID 0 to send or
receive priority tagged frames. See section `VLAN <#vlan-over-pru-ethernet>`_ for details
on how to assign egress priority mapping for the priority tagged VLAN
interface.

.. rubric:: Useful commands
   :name: Useful-commands

Internally, the VLAN filter table(s) are stored in each PRU's Data RAM
(PRU0->Data RAM0, PRU1->Data RAM1) instead of one table in Shared RAM
as for HSR/PRP.

.. rubric:: Limitation

Currently, the PRU firmware is configured to receive all of the
untagged frames from the network when the VLAN filtering is enabled.
However there is no support for port VLAN which allows these frames
to be received at a designated VLAN interface.

**Dumping VLAN table and Multicast filter table:**
Firmware maintained VLAN table and Multicast filter table can be dumped
using switch-config tool for advanced debugging. For example:

::

	root@am57xx-evm:~# switch-config -I eth2 -d
	PRUSS Ethernet driver version 0.2 Reg dump version 256

	VLAN Filter : enabled
	VLAN Filter untagged : allowed to Host
	VLAN Filter priority tagged: allowed to Host

Network Storm Prevention
--------------------------
Network storm is defined as an excessive amount of Ethernet
frames at the ingress of a network interface
causing resources being wasted in the device for processing
these frames and thereby affecting the device performance.

PRUETH driver implements a control mechanism that user can
enable to drop these frames if the number of frames received
during a window (100 msec) reaches a threshold. PRUETH uses
a credit value as the threshold which is user configurable
on a per interface and packet type (broadcast/multicast/unicast) basis.

The driver writes the credit value in DRAM based on the user tc
command. The PRU firmware uses the credit value as a counter. The
driver refreshes the counter every 100 msec.  i.e write the credit
value to memory every 100 msec. PRU Firmware upon receiving a frame
decrements this counter until it becomes zero.  Firmware forwards
the frames to Host or ARM until the counter is non zero. PRU Firmware
drops the frames if the counter is zero. Since driver writes the
credit value to DRAM every 100 msec, the number of frames sent to
host or ARM during a 100 msec window is limited to the credit value
and anything beyond that is dropped by the firmware. Firmware maintains
statistics counters, stormPrevCounterBC/stormPrevCounterMC/stormPrevCounterUC,
for the number of frames dropped due to storm prevention control
for each packet type and can be seen using ethtool -S command.

Note that this feature is disabled by default and user needs to
configure it explicitely to enable the feature. A write of non zero
value to the sysfs file enables the feature and zero disables the
feature. The value to be used may be experimented in a particular
network situation and configured by the user. E.g. In a typical network,
there will be few broadcast frames per 100 msec window such as ARP broadcast,
DHCP broadcast, router advetisement etc. So user may observe the
broadcast traffic in the network using network tools such as wireshark
and set the credit value accordingly.

Use tc command to configure the credit in unit of kbit.

To delete classifier

::

 tc qdisc del dev eth2 clsact
 tc qdisc del dev eth3 clsact

The calculation for rate is as below (29kbit in the above command).

* Credit (Packets allowed in 100 msec) = (rate_bits_per_sec  * 100) /(8 * 60 * 1000)
* In the above tc command, the rate_bits_per_sec = 29kbit = 29000. So  Credit = (29000 * 100) / (8 * 60000) ~= 6 packets

Or to get kbit/sec from credit in 100 msec,

* Rate in kbits/sec = (credit * 8 * 60) / (100)
* For 6 packets, Rate (in kbit per second) = (6 * 8 * 60) / (100) = 28.8 ~= 29

Receive Interrupt Pacing
-------------------------

Receive interrupt pacing is a firmware feature to decrease the number of
interrupts that need to be handled by the host. This control when interrupt
is generated by firmware and its use may result in less overhead in the Linux
kernel. NAPI already places the driver in a polling mode once interrupt is
triggered. If packets are bursty, all of them will be handled in a single
NAPI poll upto the NAPI budget. Once NAPI budget is reached, then driver
re-enables interrupt. However in situations where packets are randomly
spaced, then it may add additional overhead in NAPI scheduling and it is
beneficial to even out the handling using interrupt pacing.

This receive interrupt pacing allows Ethernet frames to accumulate
in the ingress ring buffer between the host and PRU for a configurable
time, and triggers an interrupt on timeout expiry. The driver processes all
queued frames upon receiving an RX interrupt. The firmware implements
this RX pacing timer, which is configured by the PRUETH driver when the
network device is opened and stopped when the device is closed. For HSR/PRP,
one RX pacing timer is shared between ports. One timer is used because
the HSR/PRP ports trigger common priority-based interrupts. For Dual EMAC,
there is one RX pacing timer per port.

The user may show the timer value using the ethtool –c option which
is a standard Linux command to show different coalesce parameters at
the network device. –C option allows user to set rx interrupt pacing
at the device.  There are limited number of buffers in the receive
path between Host and PRU and using a bigger value can result in
packet loss. ethtool –c option is implemented in the PRUETH driver
to show current setting in the driver and -C to change it if needed.
Driver supports rx-usecs and adaptive-rx parameters from the available
list of parameters. There are 3 modes of pacing available:

**Pacing enabled :**
At each timer expiry, firmware checks if any frames were received during the
interval, and if so triggers an interrupt. Frames received during timer interval
set a flag but do not trigger an interrupt.

**Adaptive pacing enabled:**
At each timer expiry, firmware checks if any frames were received during the
interval, and if so triggers an interrupt. Frames received during timer interval
in an *empty* queue trigger an interrupt immediately, frames received to a
non-empty queue set a flag but do not trigger an interrupt. (This can help
improve latency when using pacing, but is disabled by default because as it
results in lower throughput.)

**Pacing disabled:**
An interrupt is triggered for each frame received. By default interrupt
pacing is disabled at the PRUETH interface and user has to use ethtool command
to enable it.

Example

To show the current value of pacing timer, use

::

 >ethtool –c <Ethernet interface>

To change the current value, use

::

 >ethtool –C <Ethernet interface> <param> <value> <param> <value>

For example for eth2, user type

::

 >ethtool –c eth2

Note that this changes the timer at both PRUs (for HSR/PRP). So the command
may be issued to one of the pair of Ethernet interfaces used for the HSR
or PRP interface.
i.e for ICSS2 (assuming eth2 and eth3), user may use either of the below
command to set the timer

::

 >ethtool –C eth2 rx-usecs 123

or

::

 >ethtool –C eth3 rx-usecs 123

Similarly to enable adaptive-rx, user types

::

 >ethtool –C eth2 adaptive-rx on

or

::

 >ethtool –C eth3 adaptive-rx on

Both parameters may be updated in one go as

::

 >ethtool –C eth2 rx-usecs 123 adaptive-rx on

More details on the command syntax are available by typing man ethtool
on a Linux PC as this is a standard Linux command.

VLAN Tag in Supervision frame
-----------------------------

HSR/PRP protocol standard IEC62439-3 defines that the PRP_Supervision frame
as well as HSR_Supervision frames optionally include a VLAN tag header.
Starting with Processor SDK 5.1.x, VLAN tag is supprted in Linux HSR/PRP
implementation.

In Linux, user use the ip link add command to create an HSR/PRP
interface. ip link command is supported by the iproute2 package which is an open
source software. hsr or prp type is currently a supported link type by ip
link command. To support VLAN tag in SV frames, the command now accepts
3 more parameters from user. They are:-

 * VLAN Identifier (VID) - sv_vid
 * Priority code point (PCP) - sv_pcp
 * Drop eligible indicator  (DEI) or formerly known as Canonical Format Indicator (CFI) - sv_dei

User provides following values in the ip link add command for this purpose.

::

 sv_vid <vid value> sv_pcp <pcp value> sv_dei <dei value>

These are all optional parameters. At least one of the value to be provided
to use vlan. A default value of zero is used if not supplied by the user.

Node Table
----------

HSR/PRP offloaded LRE supports a Node Table (NT) of 256 entries on AM5
devices and 128 entries on AM3/4 devices. NT entries are maintained in
shared RAM of the PRU ICSS. For HSR, an entry containing the MAC address
of the remote node is inserted to the Node table when a supervison(SV) frame
is received from that node. For PRP, this gets added for any frame received
from the node. Firmware first looks up the address in the NT upon receiving
a SV frame. The look up status is indicated in a bit in the buffer descriptor.
The same is checked by the driver and if the look up status indicates no
success, the MAC entry is inserted to the NT by driver.  For subsequent
frames received from the node, the firmware updates the NT and the insertion
process is skipped in the driver.

The driver also runs an ageing timer to forget the node if there was no
frame received from the remote node for a period of time as specified by
the standard. During the timeout, if the entry is aged, then the same is
deleted from the NT.

In Summary, search/update of an NT entry is done in firmware and insert/
delete of an entry is done by the driver.

The NT entries can be displayed by the user at the console using the proc
file /proc/<if_name>/node-table.

Example: If the interface name is prp0, a sample command is shown below to
display the NT entries.

::

 root@am57xx-evm:~# cat /proc/prp0/node-table

Net-SNMP
--------

The TI SDK release ships tisdk-default-image-am57xx-evm.tar.xz with
Net-SNMP 5.8 binaries pre-installed and snmpd is started as part of
the user space initialization. TI has developed a Net-SNMP module to
support IEC-62439-3 related MIB access at the DAN using snmp commands
such as snmpwalk, snmpget etc. **NOTE:** IEC-62439-3 MIB is supported
only in the offloaded case. So user is expected to create HSR/PRP
interface with offload. For details on how to setup HSR/PRP interface
with offload, please refer :ref:`SITARA_HSR_PRP_Testing_Firmware_Offload`

iproute2
--------

iproute2 is enhanced to allow creating a prp interface similar to hsr
interface using two slave interfaces.

Test Procedure
---------------
.. _SITARA_HSR_PRP_Testing_Firmware_Offload:

Testing HSR/PRP Firmware Offload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The setup of the IDKs for testing HSR/PRP firmware offload and the
configuration of the HSR/PRP interfaces after kernel boot up are no
different than the case without firmware offload. The differences are,
in the case of firmware offload, the correct PRU firmware needs to be
loaded and the PRUETH driver needs to be configured to interface with
the type of firmware loaded, during ndo_open() or when interface is up.

To verify PRU Ethernet type after boot, do following that display TI PRU
ethernet type

::

    dmesg | grep "EMAC mode"

Now change Ethernet type to HSR or PRP as explained :ref:`Changing_protocol_at_PRU_Ethernet`

Node Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^
In the case of HSR/PRP firmware offload, the Node Table can be displayed
as follows. Note: the locations are different from those when there is
no firmware offload.

To show the **HSR Node Table** do below command (assume hsr0 is the
interface name)

 >cat /proc/hsr0/node-table

Sample display

::

 root@am57xx-evm:~# cat /proc/hsr0/node-table
  Remote nodes in network: 1
  Node[0]:
  DANH
  MAC ADDR: 70:ff:76:1c:0e:0d
  Time Last Seen: RxA=5015 RxB=5015

To show the PRP Node Table, under the kernel prompt on the terminal connected to the IDK, do (assume prp0 is the interface name)

 >cat /proc/prp0/node-table

Sample display

::

 root@am57xx-evm:~# cat /proc/prp0/node-table
  Remote nodes in network: 1
  Node[0]:
  MAC ADDR: 70:ff:76:1c:0e:0d
  DANP
  Time Last Seen: RxA=4094 RxB=4414

LRE Statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is a lre-stats file to dump this under /proc/<hsr/prp interface name>. For
example to dump this for prp0 interface, do:

::

 root@am57xx-evm:~# cat /proc/prp0/lre-stats
    LRE statistics:
    Rx Offloaded: 1
        lreTxA: 15915369

.. _SITARA_HSR_Testing:

HSR Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test HSR, user would need two AM572x EVMs.

#. Setup HSR Ring network as per diagram below. Connect the PRU2ETH0
   (See the marking on the EVM) Ethernet ports of the two EVMs together
   (corresponds to Linux interface eth2) as shown below. Similarly,
   connect the PRU2ETH1 ports (Linux interface eth3) as well.

#. Boot the EVMs using the pre-built images from the Processor SDK
   release. These images are built with Linux HSR/PRP driver enabled.
   Login to the console using root user name.

#. Now change Ethernet type to HSR as
   explained :ref:`Changing_protocol_at_PRU_Ethernet`

#. Note the MAC Address of eth2 at DAN-H-1(Say MAC-A) using the ifconfig
   command. Do ifconfig eth2 at the Linux console of DAN-H-1
#. Note the MAC Address of eth2 at DAN-H-2(Say MAC-B) using the ifconfig
   command. Do ifconfig eth2 at the Linux console of DAN-H-2

   #. ifconfig eth2 down
   #. ifconfig eth3 down
   #. ifconfig eth3 hw ether <MAC-A>
   #. ifconfig eth2 up
   #. ifconfig eth3 up
   #. ip link add name hsr0 type hsr slave1 eth2 slave2 eth3 supervision
      45 version 1
   #. ifconfig hsr0 <IP Address of hsr interface at DAN-H-1> up

#. Repeat the above steps for DAN-H-2, but this time use MAC-B in step
   4.3 above. And use IP Address from the same subnet as that of DAN-H-1
   hsr interface hsr0.

.. Image:: /images/Hsr-network-setup-v2.jpg

For example use Ip Address 192.168.2.10 for DAN-H-1 and 192.168.2.20 for
DAN-H-2. Assume CPSW ports at the EVM are on a different Subnet than the
HSR interface.

Once both hsr0 interfaces are created, user should be able to do a ping
from DAN-H-1 to DAN-H-2 or vice-versa. Disconnect Ethernet cable at eth2
or eth3. The Ping should continue to go through. User could run iperf
between the two HSR interfaces and test the iperf is not affected when
one of the cable is disconnected. This verifies redundancy.

A Sample script that automates the steps using eth2 and eth3 is provided
below

::

 #!/bin/sh
 #<args: <hsr|prp>
 # on AM57x only
 # Dual EMAC to HSR/PRP on DUT-A
 if [ "$#" != "1" ]
 then
	echo "$0 <hsr|prp>"
 	exit
 fi

 if [ "$1" != "hsr" ] && [ "$1" != "prp" ]
 then
	echo "$0 <hsr|prp>"
 	exit
 fi

 if [ "$1" == "hsr" ]
 then
	if=hsr0
 else
	if=prp0
 fi

 ifa=eth2
 ifb=eth3
 ip=192.168.2.10
 mac=70:FF:76:1C:02:0A
 echo "ip=$ip"
 echo "if=$if"
 echo "mac=$mac"
 echo "slave-a=$ifa"
 echo "slave-b=$ifb"

 ifconfig $ifa 0.0.0.0 down
 ifconfig $ifb 0.0.0.0 down
 ifconfig $ifa hw ether $mac
 ifconfig $ifb hw ether $mac
 if [ "$1" == "hsr" ]
 then
	ethtool -K $ifa hsr-rx-offload on
	ethtool -K $ifb hsr-rx-offload on
 else
	ethtool -K $ifa prp-rx-offload on
	ethtool -K $ifb prp-rx-offload on
 fi

 ifconfig $ifa up
 ifconfig $ifb up
 if [ "$1" == "hsr" ]
 then
	ip link add name $if type hsr slave1 $ifa slave2 $ifb supervision 45 version 1 sv_vid 3 sv_pcp 7 sv_dei 0
 else
	ip link add name $if type hsr slave1 $ifa slave2 $ifb supervision 45 proto 1 sv_vid 3 sv_pcp 7 sv_dei 0
 fi

 ifconfig $if $ip
 ifconfig $if
 ifconfig $ifa
 ifconfig $ifb

To customize the script for another device, please change the mac and ip
variables. Similarly to use a different vid, pcp and dei for supervision
frame VLAN, change the same in the above script. To delete the hsr or prp
interface, user may use ip link command as

ip link delete <hsr or prp interface name>.  Example for hsr0 interface name, user type

::

 ip link delete hsr0

Note that the Ethernet interfaces should be updated with original MAC address
after this as below assuming eth2 and eth3 interfaces

::

 ifconfig eth2 0.0.0.0 down
 ifconfig eth3 0.0.0.0 down
 ifconfig eth2 hw ether 70:FF:76:1C:02:0A
 ifconfig eth3 hw ether 70:FF:76:1C:02:0B

PRP Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Image:: /images/Prp-network-setup.jpg

For Testing PRP, user is required to use the setup shown in the above
diagram. A DAN-P is attached to two independent networks (A and B) each
of which is shown as a separate Ethernet switch. Do the following steps
to setup the prp interface. Note that in the below example Linux
interface eth2 is Link-A (slave1 in ip link command) and eth3 is Link-B
(slave2 in ip link command). Link-A is the Ethernet cable that connects
DUT to Switch A and Link-B is the Ethernet cable that connects to
Switch-B. **This is very important for PRP as swapping them is an
incorrect connection and can produce undesirable results.**
Alternately user may connect Link-A to Link-A and Link-B to Link-B which
is the simplified setup where switches are replaced with ethernet cable.

#. Connect the DAN-P-1 EVM, PRU2ETH0 (marking on EVM) to a port at
   Ethernet switch A and PRU2ETH1 to a port at Ethernet switch B
#. Similarly, connect DAN-P-2 EVM, PRU2ETH0 to a port at Ethernet switch
   A and PRU2ETH1 to a port at Ethernet switch B
#. Now change Ethernet type to PRP as
   explained :ref:`Changing_protocol_at_PRU_Ethernet`
#. Boot the EVMs using the pre-built images from the Processor SDK
   release. These images are built with Linux HSR/PRP driver enabled.
   Login to the console using root user name.
#. This time user may use the script to create the prp interface. Use different
   MAC address at each DUT

Same sample script mentioned earlier for HSR Testing can be used for PRP interface
with command line parameter prp specified as argument.

Sample logs are shown below:

For PRP, the steps are similar. Create prp interface and do similar settings.

Redundancy Test and Logs
------------------------

For HSR and PRP redundancy is implemented using duplicate links and
sending frame over both links and discarding the duplicate at the
receive side. The test requires two DAN-P or DAN-H nodes connected over
eth2 and eth3 Ethernet Links. Boot up the EVM and create HSR or PRP
interfaces as described at
`Processor\_SDK\_Linux\_HSR\_PRP#Testing\_HSR.2FPRP\_Firmware\_Offload <Industrial_Protocols_HSR_PRP.html#plsdk-hsr-prp-testing-firmware-offload>`__.
Do an iperf UDP test at 88Mbits/sec for MTU sized packets (size = 1472)
and then pull out either eth2 or eth3 Ethernet cable. Make sure iperf
stats doesn't show packet loss during the test period. Here is the log
for HSR that shows link failed during the test and there was no packet
loss. Logs assume that iperf3 server runs on the other connected DUT.

FAQ
----

*  How to disable udhcpc from sending DHCP request over prueth Ethernet
   interfaces (eth2-eth3) when it is configured to run HSR/PRP protocol
   in firmware?

Linux HSR/PRP driver uses the eth2/eth3 interface as slave interfaces to
implement the protocol on top of it. Application is expected to send or
receive packets over the hsr or prp lre interface also known as C port.
However prueth also support plain Ethernet and the file system
/etc/systemd/network/10-eth.network has a general rule to enable DHCP
over all of the interface matching eth\*. Modify the file to match
unique name instead of generic name wild cards. For example to do DHCP
over only eth0 interface, 10-eth.network may be modified as follows:-

root@am57xx-evm:~# cat /etc/systemd/network/10-eth.network

::

    [Match]
    Name=eth0
    KernelCommandLine=!root=/dev/nfs

    [Network]
    DHCP=yes

To do DHCP over hsr0 or prp0 interfaces, user may add additional files
to /etc/systemd/network/ one for each prp0 or hsr0 similar to eth0, by
using a Match name string of hsr0 or prp0. More details on this is at
[`[6] <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-networkd#Configuration_files>`__]

*  Why do I see duplicate frames displayed by ping when I use PRP interface?

In ICSS firmware, PRU-0 is assumed to be for Link-A and PRU-1 for Link-B
of a LRE in the case DANP. So in PRP case, Link-A should be connected
network A and Link-B should be connected to Network B of a PRP network
since net-id has to match as per duplicate detect alogrithm. If this
convention is not followed, duplicate detection logic fails and duplicates
are sent to upper layer causing ping application to complain about duplicates.
So when creating prp interface, make sure ip link command parameter slave 1
use linux interface associated with PRU-0 and slave 2 use interface associated
with PRU-1. Also when making network connection make sure that PRU-0 port is
connected to Network A and PRU-1 port to Network B.
