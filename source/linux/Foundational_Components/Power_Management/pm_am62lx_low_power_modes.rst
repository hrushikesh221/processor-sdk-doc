Low Power Modes

Overview
********

.. note::

   For this release, both of the documented low power modes below require special steps which have been
   documented in :ref:`am62l_suspend_workarounds`. This includes the steps to choose the system suspend mode
   and how to wakeup the system.

The following sections describe a high-level description of the different low power modes (LPM) of the
device. If your application requires inactive power management, you must determine which
low power mode described below satisfies your requirements. Each mode must be evaluated
based on power consumption and latency (the time it takes to wakeup to active mode) requirements. Specific
values are detailed in the device-specific data sheet. As part of this SDK offering,
Texas Instruments has added support for the following low power modes (ordered from lowest power consumption
to highest power consumption):

#. RTC Only Plus DDR
#. Deep Sleep

RTC Only Plus DDR
*****************

RTC Only + DDR mode is the deepest low power mode that allows the system to enter a state of lowest power consumption
while still retaining the DDR RAM context.

In order to enter RTC Only + DDR mode,

DeepSleep
*********

DeepSleep AKA Suspend-to-RAM is a low-power mode that allows the SoC
to retain its state in RAM while the processor is turned off.
DeepSleep mode is typically used during inactivity when the user requires very low power
while waiting for an event that requires processing or higher performance. DeepSleep
is a low power mode which still includes DDR in self-refresh, so wakeup events do not
require a full cold boot, significantly reducing wakeup latencies.
Since the power to Always-On power domains are ON throughout DeepSleep,
power to key modules such as GPIO and others is maintained to allow wakeup events
to exit out of this mode.

In order to enter DeepSleep,
