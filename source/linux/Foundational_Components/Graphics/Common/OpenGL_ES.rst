OpenGL ES
#########

The OpenGL\ |reg| ES and EGL\ |reg| libraries packaged with the
|__SDK_FULL_NAME__| used by graphics stacks such as Wayland/Weston provide
accelerated rendering capabilities. The drivers run on an ARM core and program
the firmware running inside a GPU core with rendering commands submitted by the
user applications.
