The OpenCL\ |trade| libraries in the |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| allow offloading tasks
to the GPU for compute centric libraries without the GPU or CPU usage incurred
by managing displays or creating a offscreen context. The drivers run on an ARM
core and programs the firmware running inside a GPU core with commands submitted
by the user applications.

OpenCL\ |trade| differs from OpenGL\ |reg| in that it makes use of a predefined
Installable Client Driver (ICD) Loader to allow applications to query and pick
the device it deems necessary instead of relying on a predefined mapping between
a chosen display and backing vendor acceleration implementation. This means that
typically an application that wants to use OpenCL\ |trade| should link against
an ICD loader library instead of directly using a specific library.

.. note::

   Some tools dynamically load their respective OpenCL\ |trade| library at
   runtime by using dlopen, which can fail in Yocto based environments. This is
   usually the result of a clash in philosophies between Yocto and Application
   developers over the usage of devlinks (also know in Yocto as "dev-so"s). It
   is Yocto's belief that, for the most part, applications should not try to use
   dev links directly and should instead open the specific version of the
   library they need. You can patch the application to do this or create the
   devlink from :file:`/usr/lib/libOpenCL.so` to :file:`/usr/lib/libOpenCL.so.1`
   manually. Tools provided by Yocto will are already patched.

A useful tool for debugging OpenCL\ |trade| ICD Loaders and devices is
:command:`clinfo`. This command, when run without any arguments will present a
list of all supported devices, associated parameters, and supported extensions.
