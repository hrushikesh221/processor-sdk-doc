Vulkan
######

The Vulkan\ |reg| libraries packaged with |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| offer acceleration
for graphics stacks such as Qt and GTK. The drivers run on an ARM core and
programs the firmware running inside a GPU core with rendering commands
submitted by the user applications.

Vulkan\ |reg| is a relatively new API that focuses on increased verbosity and
control over the device as opposed to OpenGL\ |reg| ES, which was initially
intended to abstract common processing functions for developers. As a result, it
is usually advised to use an existing abstraction framework, such as the before
mentioned GTK or Qt widget based frameworks.

Similar to OpenCL\ |trade|, Vulkan\ |reg| has an Installable Client Driver (ICD)
Loader to allow applications to query and pick the device it deems necessary. It
does not relying on a predefined mapping between a chosen display and backing
vendor acceleration implementation. This means that typically an application
that wants to use Vulkan\ |reg| should link against an ICD loader library
instead of directly using a vendor specific library.

A useful tool for debugging Vulkan\ |reg| ICD Loaders and devices is
:command:`vulkaninfo`. This command, when run without any arguments will present
a list of all supported devices, associated parameters, and supported
extensions.
