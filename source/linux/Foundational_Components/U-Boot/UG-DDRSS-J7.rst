DDRSS ECC

********
Overview
********

The DDR subsystem (DDRSS) comprises DDR controller, DDR PHY and wrapper logic
to integrate these blocks in the device. For SDRAM data integrity, the DDRSS
bridge supports inline ECC on the data written to or read from the SDRAM. ECC
is stored together with the data so that a dedicated SDRAM device for ECC is
not required. The 8-bit single error correction double error detection (SECDED)
ECC data is calculated over 64-bit data quanta. For every 256-byte data block
32 bytes of ECC is stored inline. Thus 1/9th of the total SDRAM space is used
for ECC storage and the remaining 8/9th of the SDRAM data space are seen as
consecutive byte addresses. Even if there are non-ECC protected regions the
previously described 1/9th-8/9th rule still applies and consecutive byte
addresses are seen from system point of view. |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__|
supports up to 3 ECC protected non-overlapping memory ranges. The current
U-Boot release supports a single region covering the entire SDRAM space.

ECC is calculated for all accesses that are within the address ranges
protected by it. 1-bit error is correctable by ECC, but multi-bit and
multiple 1-bit errors are not correctable and will be treated as an
uncorrectable error. Any uncorrectable error will cause a bus abort.

DDRSS inline ECC handling
=========================

.. note::

   The inline ECC feature of DDRSS is not enabled by default in U-Boot.

Enabling inline ECC
-------------------

The inline ECC feature of DDRSS can be enabled by adding the
``CONFIG_K3_INLINE_ECC`` config to the R5 defconfig:

      .. code-block:: kconfig

         # u-boot/configs/*_r5_defconfig

         CONFIG_PINCTRL_SINGLE=y
         CONFIG_POWER_DOMAIN=y
         CONFIG_TI_POWER_DOMAIN=y
         CONFIG_K3_INLINE_ECC=y
         CONFIG_K3_SYSTEM_CONTROLLER=y
         CONFIG_REMOTEPROC_TI_K3_ARM64=y
         CONFIG_RESET_TI_SCI=y

This enables inline ECC for the entire region of the DDR.

Priming with BIST Engine
------------------------

The bootloader has the responsibility to pre-load the ECC protected region with
known data before functional reads and writes are performed. During the ECC
initialization, the R5 SPL fills the entire memory with zeros using the BIST
engine in the DDR controller. The BIST engine method allows priming the entire
region with zeros in much less time.

Enabling inline ECC for a partial region of the DDR
---------------------------------------------------

Instead of defaulting to enable inline ECC for the entire DDR region, a partial
range can also be selected.

In this case, the DDRSS driver expects such a node within the memory node, in
the absence of which it resorts to enabling for the entire DDR region:

   .. code-block:: dts

      inline_ecc: protected@9e780000 {
            device_type = "ecc";
            reg = <0x9e780000 0x0080000>;
            bootph-all;
      };
